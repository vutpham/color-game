# What's This RGB?

An interactive game to learn the RBG color model. It is written using pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green and blue.

## Future Improvements
- [x] Automatically reset game after 2s after the user makes a correct guess
- [x] Allow users to keep track of the number of correct guesses

- [ ] Improve the difficulty of game modes with better-generated decimal codes values
    - Easy Mode:  Decimal code values are all at least 100 away from the actual color
    - Hard Mode:  Decimal code values are within 50 away from the actual color
